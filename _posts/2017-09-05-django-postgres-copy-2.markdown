Today the California Civic Data Coalition released a new open-source tool that enables the Django web framework to more quickly export comma-delimited data.

Version 2.0 of [django-postgres-copy](http://django-postgres-copy.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/), now available on the Python Package Index, extends Django's database tools to support PostgreSQL's powerful [COPY TO](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-copy.html) command.

Found only in PostgreSQL, COPY TO can write out tables with millions of rows in a matter of seconds.

Our code, crafted by the Coalition's Lead Developer [James Gordon](https://twitter.com/je_gordon), makes using it this easy:

{% highlight python %}
Person.objects.to_csv("/path/to/your/export.csv")
{% endhighlight %}

The custom to_csv method does it all. To start using it yourself, all you need to do is install our library and add a [custom manager](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/managers/) to your model.

{% highlight python %}
from django.db import models
from postgres_copy import CopyManager


class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    objects = CopyManager()
{% endhighlight %}

Once that's done you're ready to roll. You can even export database queries that include filters, groups or other Django database tricks. For instance, this will work:

{% highlight python %}
Person.objects.exclude(first_name='BEN').to_csv('/path/to/your/export.csv')
{% endhighlight %}

And so will something like this:

{% highlight python %}
Person.objects.annotate(name_count=Count('first_name')).to_csv('/path/to/your/export.csv')
{% endhighlight %}

In cases where your model is connected to other tables with a foreign key, you can increase the number of fields exported by listing them out and calling in related tables using Django's double underscore notation.

{% highlight python %}
Person.objects.to_csv(
    '/path/to/your/export.csv',
    'first_name',
    'last_name',
    'hometown__name'
)
{% endhighlight %}

### Why do you need this?

The Coalition invented this tool as part of its open-source quest to master [CAL-ACCESS](/about/), the jumbled, dirty and difficult government database tracking money in California politics.

We are nearing the completion of a pipeline of Python code that downloads, extracts, cleans, loads, transforms and republishes the state's raw data as easy-to-understand spreadsheets. This new wrapper for COPY TO allows our pipeline to quickly and clearly export a set of simplified flat files for end users.

### What else can it do?

The library has long supported swiftly importing data files with PostgreSQL's COPY command. Starting today, that old tool is easier to access with a new from_csv method on our custom manager. Code like the following can load millions of records in your database in a matter of seconds.

{% highlight python %}
Person.objects.from_csv(
    # The source file
    "/path/to/your/import.csv",
    # A crosswalk of model fields to CSV headers.
    dict(first_name='FIRST_NAME', last_name='LAST_NAME')
)
{% endhighlight %}

### What now?

If you'd like to try our tool out for yourself, you can install it with Python's ``pip`` like so:

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install django-postgres-copy
{% endhighlight %}

To learn more about how it works, visit the [technical documentation](http://django-postgres-copy.californiacivicdata.org/). There you'll find a more complete explanation and information about some fancier tricks not covered here, like the capability to transform and clean data on-the-fly as it's loaded into the database.

Since it was [first released](https://www.californiacivicdata.org/2015/07/17/hello-django-postgres-copy/) in 2015, django-posgres-copy has drawn contributions from coders around the world, including some major improvements [from users other fields](https://www.californiacivicdata.org/2016/11/14/django-postgres-copy-0.1/).
