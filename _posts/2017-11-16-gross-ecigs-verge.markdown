Today the technology site The Verge published ["Smoke Screen,"](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16658358/vape-lobby-vaping-health-risks-nicotine-big-tobacco-marketing) a lengthy investigation into how the booming e-cigarette industry is pressuring scientists and regulators.

The author is [Liza Gross](http://www.lizagross.com/), the Coalition's [2017 NICAR scholarship winner](https://www.californiacivicdata.org/2017/01/30/liza-gross-nicar/).

[Her wide-ranging story](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16658358/vape-lobby-vaping-health-risks-nicotine-big-tobacco-marketing) covers many topics. One of them is vaping's growing lobby in the Sacramento statehouse. She writes:

> The tobacco and vaping industries have spent nearly $10 million to fight regulations on e-cigarettes and related legislation in California since 2009, state records show.

That finding, and several others in her story, are drawn from the lobbying disclosure data locked within CAL-ACCESS, the jumbled, dirty and difficult state database our project aims to open.

Gross is an independent journalist based in Kensington and a part-time editor at [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/).

She writes frequently about the intersection between science and society, specializing in environmental, public and mental health. Sheâ€™s also a reporter for the [Food & Environment Reporting Network](https://thefern.org/).
